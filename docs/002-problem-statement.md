# 002 Problem Statement

User experience on ecommerce sites is often limited by static or incomplete product information. Common challenges include:

- Difficulty retrieving relevant product details quickly.
- Product descriptions distributed across many pages and inconsistent formats.
- Limited conversational assistance for natural language product queries.
- Staleness of product data due to rapidly changing inventories and content.

These problems motivate building a system that can:

- Continuously crawl ecommerce sites to fetch fresh content.
- Organize content into searchable embeddings.
- Provide a conversational chatbot interface that answers user queries using up-to-date product information.

The system must address challenges like:

- Handling diverse webpage structures and dynamic content.
- Efficiently chunking and hashing content to avoid redundant data.
- Integrating voice and text inputs with LLMs and vector search.
