# 010 Future Scope

The current PoC lays a solid groundwork but leaves many possibilities for extension and improvement. Future efforts may consider:

---

## 1. Crawling Enhancements

- **Playwright Integration:** Faster, more robust multi-browser support.
- **Adaptive Crawl Scheduling:** Prioritize pages that change frequently.
- **Broader Site Support:** Extend to multi-domain or multi-category products.
- **Improved Error Handling:** Resilient retries and logging.

## 2. AI and NLP Improvements

- **Neural TTS:** Integration with OpenAI or other neural TTS for natural voice output.
- **Faster Whisper:** Adopt lightweight or faster speech recognition models.
- **Fine-tuning GPT Models:** Customize LLMs for ecommerce domain knowledge.
- **Multilingual Support:** Expand voice and chatbot to multiple languages.

## 3. System Architecture and UX

- **Scalability:** Deploy crawler and vector DB on cloud services with autoscaling.
- **API Layer:** Expose chatbot and vector search as REST or gRPC services.
- **Enhanced Chat Interfaces:** Add Gradio, custom web UIs, or mobile apps.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Collect user interactions to refine and retrain models.

## 4. Data & Indexing

- **Metadata Enrichment:** Add pricing, availability, ratings to vector metadata.
- **Incremental Updates:** More efficient delta updates of changed content.
- **Content Quality Filtering:** Remove irrelevant or noisy content before upsert.

This roadmap also positions the platform for real-world deployment scenarios where robustness, speed, and richer features are essential.
