# 009 Conclusion

The Periodic Crawler Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System successfully demonstrates a fully automated pipeline for:

- Crawling ecommerce product pages periodically with respect for robots.txt and sitemap discovery.
- Processing page content intelligently into chunks with deduplication using content hashing.
- Upserting data into a scalable vector database (Weaviate) equipped with OpenAI embeddings.
- Providing an interactive voice and text chatbot interface that dynamically answers product-related queries using GPT-3.5.
- Orchestrating end-to-end runs with APScheduler for continuous updates.

This prototype showcases the potential of combining crawling, semantic search, and large language models to bridge information gaps on dynamic web platforms.

The modular design emphasizes maintainability and extensibility. The integration of voice input/output enhances user experience and accessibility.

*Key achievements:*

- Reliable scheduler-driven pipeline running every 30 minutes.
- Efficient content hashing to minimize redundant processing.
- Seamless integration of Whisper ASR and OpenAI GPT for conversational AI.
- Dockerized deployment for reproducibility and ease of setup.
