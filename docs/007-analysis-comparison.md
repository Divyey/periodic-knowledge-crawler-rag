# 007 Analysis and Comparison of Approaches

## Overview

This section provides a comparative analysis of various crawling, scraping, voice integration, and chatbot methods explored in the development and testing phase of the Periodic Crawler RAG System.

It includes metrics such as crawl duration, content chunks generated, URLs found, and tool-specific pros and cons, as well as insights into voice/text input and TTS solutions.

## 5. Testing and Benchmarking Insights

### Parallel Benchmarking Script

- The `app/test/parallel_benchmark.py` script demonstrates a side-by-side runtime test of Playwright, Selenium, Scrapy, and BeautifulSoup scrapers on a target URL.
- It spawns parallel runs to compare output statistics including crawl time, total characters extracted, chunk counts, and URLs found.

### Typical Observations

- Headless browsers (Selenium, Playwright) provide richer and more complete page content due to running JavaScript.
- Playwright usually outperforms Selenium in speed and concurrency.
- Scrapy and BeautifulSoup are excellent choices for static sites where JavaScript rendering is unnecessary.
- Chunk sizes (~500 chars) and hashing provide effective deduplication and manageable vector database storage.
- Content chunk counts roughly correlate with page complexity and JS execution.

### Chatbot CLI and Vector DB Testing

- `app/chatbot/test_vector_only_chatbot.py` verifies Weaviate near-text queries with sample questions.
- `app/test/demo_chatbot_cli.py` demonstrates question answering pipeline from vector DB search to OpenAI GPT-3.5 response generation.
- `app/test/test_weaviate_vector_indexing.py` tests vector DB connectivity and indexing correctness.

## 7. Recommendations and Future Testing

- Integrate Playwright multi-page crawling more broadly based on performance gains.
- Experiment with Faster Whisper or alternative ASR models to reduce latency.
- Explore neural TTS services for improved conversational quality.
- Extend chatbot UI beyond Streamlit for richer UX.
- Collect quantitative metrics such as per-page crawl duration, CPU/memory usage during crawling, and compare semantic search precision and recall empirically.
- Generate detailed logs and dashboards to better visualize crawl coverage and data freshness.
